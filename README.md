# ShouldTODO Application

## About The App
ShouldTODO is an application created using the **Flutter framework**. Its primary function is to note down tasks that need to be done at future dates, specifying the day and even down to the hour and minute. It also allows reviewing completed tasks. Data is stored locally using **sqflite**.

## Features
- Add tasks through a **floating action button**.
- Starts with a **splash screen**.
- An onboarding screen provides an introductory overview of the application.
- The main screen contains a **bottom navigation bar** that navigates to:
    - Add Task
    - TODO Tasks
    - Done Tasks
    - Settings
- The appbar displays the main icon of the program on the left and an exit icon on the right, which prompts a confirmation message when pressed.
